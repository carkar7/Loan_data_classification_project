Filter the “loan_status” variable to only contain “Charged Off” and “Fully Paid”

Using the “loan_status” variable as the outcome, use the other variables below to develop and compare 4 different types of classification models with the train dataset that predict whether the “loan_status” should be “Charged Off” or “Fully Paid” on the test dataset.
